# In this file, I will use the various markdown features.
## They add style to what you are doing.
###### I suppose this can make it easier or harder to read what one posts.

**You can make things bold**
**You can make things italics**
***You can combine the two***
**You can _nest_ the two**
~~With the version control I don't know why strikethrough is necessary, but I guess options are good~~
I can quote someone:  >You can quote text with a ">".
I can quote someone's code:
```
git status
git add
git commit
```

I can even make a link so that others can know all about markdowns:  [Basic writing and formatting syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

Of course none of this is working, because what they don't tell you is that you have to name the file with a .md at the end.
Go to Markdown File.md, where I have copied and pasted the above and it is working fine.
